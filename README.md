## Summary  
This project examines trends in global refugee (asylum) applicant data from 2000 to 2020. Through data analytics & visualization using Python, we explore important temporal and geographic trends related to global refugee applications. 

We create 3 informative visualizations to display key insights and patterns in the data, which help highlight changes in refugee application numbers over time, as well as important trends across regions and countries.
